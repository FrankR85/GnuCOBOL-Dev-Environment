# Cobol unit testing framework for mainframe programs

The goal of the project is to enable isolated unit testing of individual paragraphs in Cobol programs in a standalone environment with no connection to a zOS system. 

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/neopragma/cobol-unit-test/wiki/) for more information.

## Description

The unit test precompiler copies the program under test and inserts test code into the WORKING-STORAGE SECTION and PROCEDURE DIVISION. You can then run the copy of the program, which executes the isolated unit test cases without running the program from start to finish.

## A brief sample

```
           TESTSUITE 'CONVERT COMMA-DELIMITED FILE TO FIXED FORMAT' 

      *****************************************************************
      * COBOL COMMENTS ARE IGNORED SO YOU CAN DO THIS SORT OF THING IF
      * YOU PLEASE.
      *****************************************************************  

           BEFORE-EACH
               MOVE FOO TO BAR
               MOVE ZERO TO WS-COUNT
           END-BEFORE

           AFTER-EACH
               INITIALIZE WS-RESULTS-TABLE
           END-AFTER

           TESTCASE 'IT CONVERTS TEXT FIELD 1 TO UPPER CASE' 
               MOVE 'something' TO TEXT-VALUE-1
               PERFORM 2100-CONVERT-TEXT-FIELD-1
               EXPECT TEXT-OUT-1 TO BE 'SOMETHING'

           TESTCASE 'IT HANDLES FILE NOT FOUND GRACEFULLY'
               MOCK
                   FILE INPUT-FILE 
                   ON OPEN STATUS FILE-NOT-FOUND
               END-MOCK    
               PERFORM 0100-OPEN-INPUT
               EXPECT WS-INPUT-FILE-STATUS TO BE '35'
               EXPECT WS-FRIENDLY-MESSAGE TO BE 'SORRY, COULDN''T FIND INPUT-FILE'
```

### Notes

The precompiler recognizes certain keywords and substitutes test code, so that you need not code a lot of boilerplate code manually. Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/neopragma/cobol-unit-test/wiki/01.%20Syntax) for syntax details.

TESTSUITE - Provides a description for a series of test cases. The description is echoed in the output from the test run.

MOCK - declares a mock. Current version has support for mocking EXEC CICS commands and rudimentary support for mocking batch file I/O. This feature is currently under active development.

BEFORE-EACH, AFTER-EACH - the precompiler copies these statements into paragraphs that are performed at the start and end of each test case.

TESTCASE - identifies a test case. The description is echoed in the output of the test run.

EXPECT - asserts an expected result. Current version supports PIC X, numeric, and 88-level compares. 

VERIFY - verifies that a mock was accessed the expected number of times.

The precompiler ignores Cobol-style comment lines.


### Examples

Compile the program ```SAMPLE```, located at ```src/main/cobol/SAMPLE.CBL```

```sh
./compile SAMPLE
```

Run the unit tests for ```SAMPLE```. Configuration file is ```src/test/resources/SAMPLEC``` and unit tests are in ```src/test/cobol/unit-tests/SAMPLET```.

```sh
./run-ut SAMPLEC SAMPLE SAMPLET
```

Run all the provided examples.

```sh
./run-examples
```

The sample programs are:

* CALLDEMO - demonstration of testing a called subprogram.
* CICSDEMO - demonstration of testing a CICS program.
* CONVERT - convert a CSV file into a fixed-format file.
* FILEDEMO - demonstration of batch file mocks.
* FIZZBUZZ - the classic FizzBuzz exercise.
* INVDATE - calculate the date of the last day of the month.
* PARADEMO - demonstration of mocking paragraphs.
* SAMPLE - minimal unit test code for a "Hello, World!" program.
* SUBPROG - demonstration of testing a called subprogram.

The unit test framework comprises:

* ZUTZCPC - the precompiler that inserts test code into a copy of the program under test.
* ZUTZCPD - PROCEDURE DIVISION copybook containing common test code.
* ZUTZCWS - WORKING-STORAGE SECTION copybook containing common test code.

### Why the funky names?

We want the unit test framework to be usable on zOS, *nix, and Windows systems. Most objects on zOS systems are limited to 8-character names, and IBM product names follow a certain pattern. We followed the same pattern in an informal way. Referring to [this document](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_1.13.0/com.ibm.zos.r13.bpxa800/bpxza8c008.htm), we did not find an existing product with the prefix ZUT. So, the names of the components in the unit testing framework mean:

* ZUT - zOS Unit Test
* ZC - zOS Cobol
* PC - precompiler
* PD - PROCEDURE DIVISION
* WS - WORKING-STORAGE
